        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages\n",
        "\n",
        "   => In compiled languages, the entire program is translated into machine code before execution, which usually makes the program run faster. In interpreted languages, the code is executed line by line at runtime, which makes them easier to debug and more flexible, but generally slower.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   => Exception handling in Python is a mechanism that allows a program to handle runtime errors gracefully. Instead of stopping the program suddenly, Python uses try and except blocks to catch errors and continue execution in a controlled way.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling\n",
        "\n",
        "   => The finally block is used to execute code that must run no matter what happens in the program. It is commonly used for cleanup tasks like closing files or releasing resources, whether an exception occurs or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   => Logging in Python is used to track and record the behavior of a program while it runs. It helps developers understand what the program is doing by saving messages related to errors, warnings, or important events.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   => The __del__ method is a destructor in Python that is automatically called when an object is no longer needed. It is mainly used to free resources such as memory, files, or network connections before the object is removed.\n",
        "   \n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   => The import statement imports the entire module, and we access its contents using the module name. The from … import statement imports specific functions or variables directly, so they can be used without the module name.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   => Multiple exceptions can be handled by using multiple except blocks or by grouping different exceptions in a single except block. This allows the program to respond differently based on the type of error.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "   => The with statement is used to open files safely and ensures that the file is properly closed after use. It helps prevent resource leaks and makes the code cleaner and easier to read.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing\n",
        "\n",
        "   => Multithreading runs multiple threads within a single process and shares the same memory space, making it suitable for lightweight tasks. Multiprocessing uses multiple processes with separate memory, which is better for CPU-intensive tasks and improves performance on multi-core systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program\n",
        "\n",
        "    => Logging helps track program execution and record errors or important events. It makes debugging easier, helps in monitoring applications, and provides useful information without interrupting the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "    => Memory management in Python refers to how Python allocates and frees memory automatically. Python uses techniques like reference counting and garbage collection to manage memory efficiently and reduce memory leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python\n",
        "    \n",
        "    => First, the risky code is placed inside a try block. If an error occurs, the control moves to the except block to handle the exception. Optional else and finally blocks can be used for code that runs when no error occurs or always runs.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "    => Memory management is important to ensure that programs run efficiently without wasting memory. Proper memory handling helps prevent memory leaks and keeps the program stable, especially for large or long-running applications.\n",
        "   \n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling\n",
        "\n",
        "    => The try block contains code that may cause an error, while the except block catches and handles the error. This prevents the program from crashing and allows it to continue running smoothly.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work\n",
        "\n",
        "    => Python automatically removes unused objects from memory using garbage collection. It mainly works through reference counting and also detects circular references to free memory when objects are no longer needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling\n",
        "\n",
        "    => The else block runs only when no exception occurs in the try block. It is used to write code that should execute if everything works correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "    => The common logging levels are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL. These levels help categorize messages based on their importance and severity.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "    => os.fork() creates a child process by copying the parent process and is mainly used in Unix-based systems. The multiprocessing module is more portable and user-friendly, allowing processes to be created and managed easily across different platforms.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "    => Closing a file is important to free system resources and ensure that all data is properly saved. If a file is not closed, it may lead to data loss or memory issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "    => file.read() reads the entire contents of a file at once, while file.readline() reads only one line at a time. readline() is useful when working with large files.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for\n",
        "\n",
        "    => The logging module is used to record messages related to a program’s execution, such as errors, warnings, and status information. It helps in debugging and monitoring applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling\n",
        "\n",
        "    => The os module allows interaction with the operating system, such as creating, deleting, and renaming files or directories. It also helps in navigating file paths.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "    => Memory management in Python can be challenging due to issues like circular references, high memory usage in large programs, and delays in garbage collection, which may affect performance.\n",
        "  \n",
        "\n",
        "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "    => An exception can be raised manually using the raise keyword. This is useful when a program needs to stop execution or handle an error based on a specific condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "\n",
        "    => Multithreading is important for improving responsiveness and efficiency in applications that perform multiple tasks at the same time, such as handling user input or network requests."
